# Cucumber Leaf Disease Classification using Custom CNN

This project uses a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cucumber leaf images into:
- Downy Mildew
- Powdery Mildew
- Healthy Leaves

## üß† Model Overview
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on ~3000 labeled images
- Achieved ~97% training accuracy and ~89% validation accuracy

## üìä Evaluation Includes:
- Accuracy & loss plots
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Per-class accuracy and sample prediction visualizations
